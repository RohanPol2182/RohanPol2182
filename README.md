Analysing and Converting data into insights? You are at the right place!!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm passionate about turning data into stories. For over 8 months, I've been diving deep into research and data analytics, transforming numbers into insights that drive decisions. I love using tools like SQL and Python to uncover hidden patterns and create visualizations that bring data to life. Whether it's conducting in-depth research or leading collaborative projects, I'm always eager to learn and grow. I'm always happy to share my insights.

* üß†  I'm learning The principles of Data Science and Statistics, focusing more on predictive analytics.
